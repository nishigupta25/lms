    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
      We can think of learning aims as concise descriptions of the overall goals
      or purposes of a piece of learning (a programme, a module or even an
      individual lecture or seminar). They are like 'mission statements' that
      encapsulate the scope and values of the offering.
